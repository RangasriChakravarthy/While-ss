# Small step WHILE interpreter-------------------------------------------------------------------HW4- SSWHILE: lexer.py, parser.py, ast.py, interpreter.py, sswhile.py, main.py, Makefile, self.batsAuthors: Rangasri Chakravarthy & Priyanka DuttaOn this homework, we worked together for 14 hours,Rangasri worked independently for 1 hours,Priyanka worked independently for 1 hours.--------------------------------------------------------------------This project was implemented in python. (HW1 and HW2 were implemented in C++)Steps to compile:- run 'make'Steps to run:- ./while-ssSteps to run the tests:- ./test.shOperations implemented:Aexp{Arithmetic expressions}, Bexp {Boolean expressions}, CommandsExtra test cases:6 extra test cases have been added and are under 'self.bats'Note: * Since we were not sure if we can maintain a public git repo (since the course is ongoing), we were pair programming and then we pushed the code to our own private git repositories(Since we could not collaborate on private repo on GitHub).
*Test case HARD-5 is failing for us, even though it's outputting what is expected.
